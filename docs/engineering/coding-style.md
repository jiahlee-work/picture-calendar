# Coding Style

These rules define common coding behavior for agents. They do not replace a
repository's formatter, linter, or type checker.

## General

- Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the request.
- Prefer clear names over comments that restate code.
- Keep functions focused and move complex branching into named helpers.
- Use early returns to reduce nesting when it improves readability.
- Avoid broad refactors, file moves, or dependency changes unless the user asks.
- Preserve existing public APIs unless the request requires changing them.

## TypeScript

- Prefer precise types over `any`.
- Use `unknown` at external boundaries and narrow before use.
- Name boolean values with prefixes that describe the condition or capability,
  such as `isOpen`, `hasError`, `canSubmit`, `shouldRender`, or `wasLoaded`.
- Keep domain types close to the code that owns them unless they are truly
  shared.
- Avoid type assertions when a guard or parser can prove the type.
- Do not silence type errors without explaining why the code is safe.

## React

- Keep render logic readable and extract components when one component has
  multiple distinct responsibilities.
- Destructure component props inside the component body unless the component is
  intentionally trivial.
- Keep component body declarations in this default order: props destructuring,
  local constants or derived IDs needed by hooks, external hooks, refs and IDs,
  state or reducer hooks, memo hooks, non-hook derived values, callback hooks,
  effect hooks, non-hook event handlers or local functions, early returns, then
  render.
- Use the declaration order as a default reading structure. If dependencies
  between hooks, derived values, or handlers make the default order harder to
  read, prefer the order that keeps data flow simplest and avoids unnecessary
  indirection.
- Treat router, params, search params, pathname, context, store selectors, and
  `useId`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and
  `useLayoutEffect` as hooks for declaration-order purposes.
- Prefer derived values over duplicated state.
- Use effects for synchronization with external systems, not for ordinary data
  derivation.
- Name event handlers by user intent, such as `handleSubmit` or
  `handleDialogClose`.
- Inline event handlers are acceptable for a single direct action, such as
  `onClick={() => selectThread(id)}`.
- Extract an event handler when the interaction includes branching, multiple
  actions, state updates, side effects, or meaningful product intent.
- Use functional state updates when the next state depends on the previous
  state, such as `setIsOpen((current) => !current)`.
- Move complex JSX conditions into named boolean values before rendering.
- Use stable domain IDs for list keys. Use array indexes only as a last resort
  for static lists that cannot reorder.
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` only when calculation cost, memoized child
  props, or dependency stability makes them useful.
- Keep loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states explicit when they
  are user-visible.

## Error Handling

- Do not silently swallow errors in `catch` blocks. Handle them, rethrow them,
  or log enough context for diagnosis.

## Comments

- Add comments only when they explain non-obvious intent, constraints, or
  tradeoffs.
- Do not leave stale TODOs or comments that describe what a line of code already
  says.
